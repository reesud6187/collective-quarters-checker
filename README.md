# Collectible Quarter Validator 
ðŸª™  ||  This side project was created to help my dad with his massive coin collection. 

ðŸ’¾  ||  Instead of checking manually through his books and jars of coins, this project writes user inputs into an .rtf using json to check whether the coin is new or in a collection already.
